         <h2>HTML</h2>

         The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
         a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such
         as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
         <br><br>
         Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
         multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
         its appearance.
         <br><br>
         HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
         interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
         by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
         HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img &gt; and &lt;input
         &gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p &gt; and &lt; /p &gt; surround and
         provide information
         about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
         interpret the content of the page.
         <br><br>
         HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
         content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
         Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
         use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
         video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.
