         <h2>JavaScript</h2>

         JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
         technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
         client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
         dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
         <br><br>
         JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11]
         It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
         supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
         interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
         Object Model (DOM).
         <br><br>
         The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
         facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
         <br><br>
         JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
         variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
         <br><br>
         Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
         are distinct and differ greatly in design.
